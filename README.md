# Hi, I'm Garrett Herrington

I'm a U.S. Navy veteran and Data Science master's student passionate about turning raw data into usable products. I focus on building real-world, portfolio-ready projects that showcase data engineering, analysis, and machine learning.

### Current Projects
- 🔧 End-to-end vehicle listings pipeline (web scraping → PostgreSQL → API)  
- 🌞 Solar energy analytics using Azure (ADF + ADLS + Power BI)  
- 📊 ML experiments: clustering, predictive modeling, and more

### Tools & Technologies
Python | SQL | PostgreSQL | Azure Data Factory | Data Lake Storage  
Power BI | Scikit-Learn | Pandas | Git | API Development

### Goals
I'm preparing for roles in:
- Data Engineering  
- Data Analytics  
- Machine Learning / MLOps foundations  

Looking to connect, learn, and build impactful data systems.
